Description: This package provides tools for data-driven statistical analysis using nonparametric instrumental variables methods. We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the GNU GSL authors. In particular, we adapt the GNU GSL B-spline routine gsl_bspline.c adding automated support for quantile knots (in addition to uniform knots), providing missing functionality for derivatives, and for extending the splines beyond their endpoints.
